```

                          so .com
             Such domain
                                  Wow!
    much www
```

Stops WordPress from redirecting based on the siteurl option by setting siteurl
to the current domain. Useful for multiple domains pointed at the same site,
local testing, and preventing the dreaded www redirect loop. Or possibly totally
useless. Definitely the smallest plugin ever.

## Installation

1. [Download from github](https://github.com/nathancarnes/wow-such-domain/archive/master.zip)
2. Install to Wordpress:

   ![Add New Plugin](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/27160/2055299/b291909e-8ac2-11e3-80f3-a29504fb7d6b.png)

   ![Upload](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/27160/2055303/c10debb8-8ac2-11e3-9607-ba81b51fbfd9.png)

   Then upload the file you just downloaded.

   ![Activate](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/27160/2055317/e4c6757a-8ac2-11e3-9e6c-62a875d41f96.png)

   Then you should be good to go, Wordpress will stop redirecting ALL THE TIME!
